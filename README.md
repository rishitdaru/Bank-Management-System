# Bank-Management-System

This is a **JAVA** based desktop application which simulates a real-world ATM machine but with additonal faciltity to create an account (Sign Up).

The database management system used that has been used is **MySQL** (I have worked with SQL, Oracle, Prometheus, and InfluxDB before, never worked with MYSQL before so this was a good experience)

I used **Netbeans** for development, this IDE was chosen because it is widely used by most programmers due to its excellent tools for design forms of the Swing GUI. (Again, I have worked with Eclipse, VSCode, MyEclipse, PyCharm, etc before but I had never used Netbeans, so this served as a good experience in adding one more IDE to my toolkit)

The main frameworks used include:
- **JAVA AWT**: an API to develop GUI applications in Java. 
- **Swing**: a GUI widget toolkit for Java (it is a part of Java Foundation Classes)
